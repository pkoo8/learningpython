### Top 10 things to Remember Day 1 
#### [Python Programming Basics]()

##### Chapter 1 : Python Basics

1. Operator Precedence (Math)
   - ** - Exponent
   - %  - Modulus / Remainder
   - // - Integer Division / Floored Quotient
   - /  - Division
   - *\ - Multiplication
   - -\ - Subtraction
   - +\ - Addition

2. Common Data Types
   - Integers - int
   - Floats (Floating Point Numbers) - float
   - Strings - str

3. String Concatenation and Replication - '+ ' & '*'

4. Variable :
   - A variable is like a box in the computer’s memory where you can store a single value. If you want to use the result of an evaluated expression later in your program, you can save it inside a variable.
   - You’ll store values in variables with an assignment statement. An assignment statement consists of a variable name, an equal sign (called the assignment operator), and the value to be stored

5. Variable Names :
   - It can be only one word.
   - It can use only letters, numbers, and the underscore ( _ ) character.
   - It can’t begin with a number.
6. Variable names are case-sensitive, meaning that spam , SPAM , Spam , and sPaM are four different variables. It is a Python convention to start your variables with a lowercase letter.

7. Functions:
    - The `print()` function displays the string value inside the parentheses on the screen.You can also use this function to put a blank line on the screen; just call print() with nothing in between the parentheses.
    - The `input()` function waits for the user to type some text on the keyboard and press enter .
    - You can pass the `len()` function a string value (or a variable containing a string), and the function evaluates to the integer value of the number of characters in that string.

8. `str() int () float () round ()`

9. >Programming is simply the act of entering instructions for the computer to perform. These instructions might crunch some numbers, modify text, look up information in files, or communicate with other >computers over the Internet.

10. > Consistency with the style guide is important. But most importantly: know when to be inconsistent—sometimes the style guide just doesn’t apply. When in doubt, use your best judgment.
