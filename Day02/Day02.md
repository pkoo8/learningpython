### Top 10 things to Remember Day 2 
#### [Python Programming Basics]()

##### Chapter 2 : Flow Control

1. Data Type `Boolean` - has only two values True/False
2. Comparison Operators 
    - ==  Equal to
    - !=  Not Equal to
    - <   Less Than
    - \>  Greater Than
    - <=  Less than or Equal to
    - \>= Greater than or Equal to
3. The Difference Between the == and = Operators
    - The == operator (equal to) asks whether two values are the same as each other.
    - The = operator (assignment) puts the value on the right into the variable on the left.
4. Boolean Operators - `and,or and not` used to compare boolean values
    - The and operator evaluates an expression to True if both Boolean values are True ; otherwise, it evaluates to False .
    - On the other hand, the or operator evaluates an expression to True if either of the two Boolean values is True . If both are False , it evaluates to False .
    - The not operator simply evaluates to the opposite Boolean value.
5. Order of precedence for boolean operators 
    - Python evaluates the not operators first, then the and operators, and then the or operators.
